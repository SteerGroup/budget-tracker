# Budget Tracker

This is a collaborative project being coded during Steer's coding office hours. The tool is a simple project budget tracker that provides the following functionality:

- takes project name, budget, timeline, staff info as inputs
- returns used budget/budget remaining/burn rates
- tracks project snapshots and can report progress over time
